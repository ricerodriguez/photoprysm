* Free software: GNU General Public License v3
* Documentation: https://photoprysm.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Made to work with the popular Requests_ package
* Session management for both Users and Clients

.. _Requests: https://requests.readthedocs.io

Quickstart
----------

To start, you need a `User` or `Client` instance.

>>> import photoprysm
>>> user = photoprysm.User('username', 'password')
>>> server_api = photoprysm.get_api_url('localhost:2342')

You can either login with the `User` or `Client` handle and log out later...

>>> session = user.login(server_api)
>>> # Do some stuff
>>> user.logout()

Or you can use the context manager so that it will log out automatically when you are done.

>>> with photoprysm.user_session(user, server_api) as session:
>>>     # Do some stuff
>>> # Logged out
